    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Aloo Poori is a popular North Indian dish consisting of deep-fried whole
      wheat bread (poori) served with a spicy and flavorful potato curry. The
      dough for pooris is prepared with whole wheat flour and mashed potatoes,
      resulting in a soft and fluffy texture. The potato curry is cooked with
      onions, ginger, and aromatic spices, creating a delicious accompaniment to
      the crispy pooris.
